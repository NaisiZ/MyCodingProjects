CS360L – F
Week 13
Name:
ID:
Class: CS360L – F
Your lab should include:
 The questions and your answers
 The screenshot of your program running (console)
 The source code (*.cpp), attached along this file in a .zip file
If your lab is missing any of these 3 points, it won’t be graded. Please write your answers in this
file.
1. Create a class named Shape:
 Create 1 private variables named length & width
 Create get and set function for length and width
 Create 2 pure virtual function getArea and getPerimeter
2. Create a class named Rectangle inherits Shape class:
 Implement getArea, and getPerimeter
3. Create a class named Square that inherits Shape class:
 Implement getArea and getPerimeter
4. In main function:
 Create 2 objects named rect1 and rect2 for rectangle class
 Create 2 objects named sqr1 and sqr2 for rectangle class
 Create 4 pointers objects of the Shape class pointing to the objects of Rectangle and
Square
 With the help of the pointers: set the length and width for rect1 and rect2
 Similarly, set the length for sqr1 and sqr2
 With the help of the pointers: Print the area and Perimeter of all 4 objects.
